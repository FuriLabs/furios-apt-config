# glibc updates are always nasty since we need to update
# it on the buildd as well (which is not an automatic
# process). Pin the major version of glibc here so that
# it won't trigger libhybris removal should glibc
# be updated in debian before we're ready
#Package: libc-bin libc-dev-bin libc6 locales libc6-dev
